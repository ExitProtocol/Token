## 🚀 Project Overview

**EXIT//AI** is a cutting-edge, real-time threat detection and privacy-first AI framework developed in-house by $EXIT Labs. Integrated at Layer-0 protocol level, EXIT//AI enables autonomous infrastructure resilience, dynamic privacy adaptation, and advanced threat mitigation for blockchain ecosystems.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Adaptive Threat Intelligence Engine:** An ensemble of Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, and Gaussian Mixture Models for anomaly detection.
- **Reinforcement Learning Obfuscation:** PPO-based agents dynamically obfuscate transaction paths under network stress.
- **Federated Learning Infrastructure:** Privacy-preserving global model updates without exposing user data.
- **Natural Language Protocol Interpreter (NLPI):** Fine-tuned Large Language Model parsing smart contract logic to identify malicious intent.
- **Cryptographic Integrity:** Model versioning via IPFS and on-chain hash commitments for training proof.
